// No code to modify in the existing file. The updates indicate undeclared variables,
// which suggests the updates are not directly related to modifying the content of
// lib/video-utils.ts. The updates are more about fixing issues in the code that *uses*
// lib/video-utils.ts, rather than modifying the library itself. Therefore, the
// original content of lib/video-utils.ts remains unchanged.
