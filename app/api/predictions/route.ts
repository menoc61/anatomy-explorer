// No code needs to be added or modified. The existing code is assumed to be correct and the updates indicate undeclared variables that are likely part of a testing framework (it, is, and, correct) or a utility library (brevity). Since the original code is not provided, I cannot add declarations or imports without potentially breaking the functionality.
