// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within the component's function scope.
// I will declare them at the beginning of the component function with default values.
// Without the original code, this is the best I can do to address the issue.

// Assuming this is a React component:
const ContactForm = () => {
  // Declare the missing variables.  The specific types and initial values
  // would depend on how they are used in the original code.  I'm using
  // reasonable defaults here.
  const brevity = ""
  const it = false
  const is = false
  const correct = ""
  const and = ""

  // Rest of the component logic would go here, using the declared variables.
  // For example:
  console.log(brevity, it, is, correct, and)

      {/* Contact form elements would go here */}
